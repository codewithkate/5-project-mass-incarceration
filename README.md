Project 5: Mass Incarceration Analysis

By: Kate Crawford, Amanda Walsh, Revathi Satkuna and Yohannes Abebe

## Overview

For this project our aim was to focus on sentencing guidelines and predict how those guidelines change the way cases are sentenced. 
As a team, we constructed a problem where we are working for the U.S. Sentencing Commision 
to provide insights into sentencing trends in order to identify areas for policy reform related to trial 
proceeding rights. The aim of this project was to look at the trends in sentencing as federal sentencing guidelines 
changed over time due to the Booker vs US 2005 Supreme Court Decision to redefine sentencing minimums.
U.S. vs Booker created regulations around sentencing
to ensure defendants have a fair trial and ultimately fair trial outcomes. Our goal was to explore how these regulations actually impact 
sentencing and to provide recommendations from our findings.

## Summary of Findings and Conclusions 

We found that over time, sentencing was becoming less indicative of crime features 
and more indicative of time of year, sentencing time period, and the district where sentencing took place. 
There was a focus on guideline minimums put in place by the Booker decision and other decisions similar in nature during the time period of 1996-2011.
These guideline decisions were weighted greater than crime related features and 
overall sentencing impact. We also found biases in data collection, where documented verses undocumneted immigrants were grouped together, we found biases
in gender assumption, as well as in race. Based on this information, our recommendation is the following: 

1. To inform research for lobbying efforts on federal sentencing guidelines
2. To target politicians from circuit districts with high bias rates 
3. To focus on reducing bias in federal sentencing guidelines

As sentencing is a complex, multi-factorial issue, there is more research to be done to provide further recommendations. 
Continued research should implemented to 
look more deeply into the specific districts where bias may be occuring, and to further look into the specific population groups
these biases are impacting. Narrowing down specific targeted features will also provide a clearer understanding of the direct impact these features have
on sentencing outcomes.
